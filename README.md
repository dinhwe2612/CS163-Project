# Project for CS163
This is an off-line dictionary, created by Group 11 for the CS163 Lab Project.

With the knowledge from CS163 sessions, we will apply the data structure to make the dictionary efficient in searching, edit, store data,... so that it can become a complete Dictionary product.

Technology used: C++, Raylib.

This is easily installed by downloading all the files and running it as a project on Visual Studio, further library installation is not needed.
